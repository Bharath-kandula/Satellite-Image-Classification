# Satellite-Image-Classification
Here is the link to the dataset: http://weegee.vision.ucmerced.edu/datasets/landuse.html
A machine learning model is developed by fine tuning the VGG16 and Inception-V3 to detect and classify the satellite view land images.
Step1: First download the dataset using the above link. 
Step2: divide the dataset into trainset and test set. If you want to do it in Google colab I recommend uploading the dataset to google drive.
Step3: Execute the code.
